## General info
New things I learned:


1)Using data-key to create custom attributes to store custome data for the application. [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_global_data.asp)

2)It was interesting to see how to grab these custom attributes in JavaScript using `[data-key = ]`

3)Using currentTime to manipulate the time in an audio or video file [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/av_prop_currenttime.asp)
